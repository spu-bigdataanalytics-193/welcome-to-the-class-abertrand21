# Homework Assigment 1 #

In this first assigment for DS 610 we were asked to create a function that would print our name.
To do so I decided to use Jupyther on Python and created a class called MyName.The function displays my name but it could also be used for anyone's. 

Later I uploaded my assigment with the file called __ArthurBertrand_HW1.ipynb__ 


Then we were asked to change the name of the README.md file to instructions.md and create a new README.file (this one) that would explain the work that was done.
